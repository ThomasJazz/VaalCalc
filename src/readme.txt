####################### DEVELOPMENT ########################
PoE VaalCalc was developed by Thomas Jaszczult and Taylor Morse as a personal
help tool to help automate the process of determining the probability of a 
given implicit stat being rolled when corrupting an item. Artwork was taken 
from loading screens seen in Path of Exile.

################## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ##################
- More information about the probabilities of possible rolls can be found by 
clicking "details" on the summary screen.
- The expected profitability report should be taken with a grain of salt. 
These numbers are generated with the assumption that any outcome other than
desired implicit being rolled (including no change to the item at all) renders 
the item completely worthless (0 chaos) which is obviously not true in most 
cases. More functionality may be added in the future to make this more reasonable.
